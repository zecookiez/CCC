## Canadian Computing Competition
This repository contains solutions to recent problems found in the University of Waterloo's Canadian Computing Competition (CCC).

Most solutions will be written either in Python 2.7, Python 3.8, or C++11.

For some problems, I will attempt to point out some next step optimizations that can speed up the solution, but these won't be necessary for the problem itself.

The following codes and solutions are tested on https://dmoj.ca/ and on the CCC Grader for correctness testing.
