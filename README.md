## CanadianComputingCompetition
This repository contains some of solutions to some of the problems found in Waterloo's Canadian Computing Competition (CCC)

Most solutions will be written either in Python 2.7, Python 3, or C++.

If possible I'll even attempt to point out some next step optimizations that can speed up the solution even further, but these won't be necessary for the problem itself. Maybe even some good resources to point to.

The following codes and solutions are tested on https://dmoj.ca/ and on the CCC Grader for correctness testing.
